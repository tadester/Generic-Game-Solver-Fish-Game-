GeneticAlgorithmGameSolver is a Java program by Tade Obasan that uses genetic algorithms to solve a game. It reads game boards from files, processes instructions, and calculates scores. Made to imitate the fish game
# Genetic Algorithm Game Solver

## Overview
This Java program, created by Tade Obasan, is designed to solve a game using genetic algorithms. It reads game boards from files, processes instructions, and calculates scores to determine the optimal solution.

## Prerequisites
Before running this program, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- A Java compiler (e.g., `javac`)
- A Java runtime environment (JRE)

## Usage
Follow these steps to compile and run the program:

1. **Compile the Code:**
   Open your command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory containing the `GeneticAlgorithmGameSolver.java` file. Use the following command to compile the code:
   ``shell
   javac GeneticAlgorithmGameSolver.java
## Run the Program:
Run the program with two command-line arguments: the game board file and a string of instructions. Use the following command as an example:
shell
Copy code
java GeneticAlgorithmGameSolver game_board.txt LRUD
Replace game_board.txt with the path to your game board file.

Replace LRUD with a string of instructions (L for left, R for right, U for up, D for down).
Input
Game Board File: A text file representing the game board. The file should be formatted with integers separated by commas.
Output
The program will output the final score or a message indicating that an invalid move was made.
